    <p>
      I am a software developer with <span id="years-experience"></span> years
      of experience mostly in web development and related fields. I have a
      passion for web and mobile app development using hybrid and native-ish
      technologies. Within the past couple of years I have acquired a passion
      for TypeScript as a language and RxJS as a library. I also really enjoy
      infrastructure as code although I don't get to work with it as much as I
      would like. I enjoy working with node.js as a command line tool, back end
      or server as well as various kinds of relational and non-relational
      databases, mostly MySQL and MongoDB. I am tangentially interested in some
      other languages and platforms including Rust and Elixir.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to software development as a career, I am also an
      instructor, manager, mentor, and researcher. Elegant software development
      is a passion of mine ... and something I hope to be able to do myself
      some day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above anything else, I'm a husband and stepfather. I live a quiet life
      and enjoy reading, watching modern and classic movies and TV cooking,
      I partake in all kinds of spectator sports including watching football
      and video game speedrunning alike. I also play various kinds of video
      games with friends and family when I have the time and desire but not
      nearly as much as I used to. I love all kinds of electronic music.

      <h1>Frontend Development</h1>
      <p>
        I focus mostly on single page applications using React and Angular. I
        have a strong preference for TypeScript. Most of my work is done for
        clients in the retail space. I also use Ionic and React Native to build
        full fledged native applications for iOS and Android. In the past, I've
        worked on large scale commercial websites PHP with jQuery and even some
        vanilla JS and custom-made frameworks.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h1>Backend Development</h1>
      <p>
        Most of my back end work uses node.js. I work on small to large web APIs
        and libraries using node.js, more recently with TypeScript. I have also
        worked with all kinds of scripting languages including python and ruby
        as well as compiled languages and frameworks ranging from rust to Elixir
        and Elm. I started out as a PHP develop on the LAMP stack.
      </p>

      <h1>Persistence</h1>
      <p>
        I have worked with a wide range of persistence technologies from
        database to caching to search. This includes relational SQL and
        non-relational/document-driven so-called NoSQL databases. I use
        variations of MySQL as well as MongoDB most frequently. I originally
        started with MySQL on the LAMP stack and have since worked with both
        Percona and MariaDB as variations.
      </p>

      <h1>Infastructure</h1>
      <p>
        I'm very passionate about IaC and serverless development. I think that
        IaC concepts are still emerging, and I'm excited to work with them when
        I can since I think that they are the path forward to true DevOps. Most
        of my infrastructure work involves AWS, but I have worked with other
        providers when needed.
