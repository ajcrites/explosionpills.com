      I am a software developer with <span id="years-experience"></span> years
      of experience mostly in web development and related fields. I have a
      passion for web and mobile app development using hybrid and native-ish
      technologies. Within the past couple of years I have acquired a passion
      for TypeScript as a language and RxJS as a library. I also really enjoy
      infrastructure as code although I don't get to work with it as much as I
      would like. I enjoy working with node.js as a command line tool, back end
      or server as well as various kinds of relational and non-relational
      databases, mostly MySQL and MongoDB. I am tangentially interested in some
      other languages and platforms including Rust and Elixir.

      In addition to software development as a career, I am also an
      instructor, manager, mentor, and researcher.

      Above anything else, I'm a husband and stepfather. I live a quiet life
      and enjoy reading, watching modern and classic movies and TV cooking,
      I partake in all kinds of spectator sports including watching football
      and video game speedrunning alike. I also play various kinds of video
      games with friends and family when I have the time and desire but not
      nearly as much as I used to. I love all kinds of electronic music.
